# Repeat Reminders
Repeat Reminders is an app for the iPhone and the iPad that was created to remind the user of repeating tasks / obligations. It allows the user to see tasks that repeat daily, weekly, monthly, of course. In addition, it allows the user to see irregularly repeating tasks such as those on the 2nd Tuesday of every month. 

The user can see a colorful list of the reminders, that progress through the rainbow, red being the closest and most attention grabbing duty. These tasks can be swiped to mark them as completed, relegating them to a later position, with a less demanding color.
